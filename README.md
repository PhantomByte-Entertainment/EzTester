# EzTester

EzTester is a powerful package that provides a range of tools to simplify testing in your Unity projects:

## Ez3DMouseCursor
Ez3DMouseCursor allows you to test collisions, triggers, and more using the mouse. You can also attach custom objects for testing purposes.

## EzMesure Suite
EzMesure Suite offers various measurement capabilities. You can compute and retrieve the distance between two objects, choose whether to display it in the game view or only in the debug view. Additionally, you can calculate the angle between two objects on the Y and X axes.

## RaycastViewer and RaycastHitter
RaycastViewer and RaycastHitter are essential tools for debugging raycasts. You can visualize the raycasts in the scene and easily identify which objects they hit. These tools can also serve as a foundation for implementing raycast features in your project.

## Moq Library
The Moq library is included in EzTester, providing support for unit testing and mocking. To use Moq in your tests, simply add the DLLs as references in your test assembly definition file under the Assembly References section. Once applied, you can start leveraging Moq in your tests.

You can check the example in the demo folder.
